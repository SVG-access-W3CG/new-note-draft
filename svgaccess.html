  <title>New SVG accessibility note - DRAFT</title>

  <h1>SVG 2 accessibility</h1>

  <p>This is a stub. The idea is to add to it until it turns into a document. That will take a lot of pull requests.</p>

  <p>Editor: chaals</p>

  <h2>Things that are still true</h2>

  <p>i.e. since the publication of SVG 1 and the poor <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SVG-access-20000807">old SVG accessibility note</a></p>

  <h3>basic shapes</h3>

  <p>to the extent that these can be helpful in understanding geometry, they are still there. 
  Unfortunately there is a tendency in practice to use a lot of paths instead. While paths
  offer a great deal of flexibility, they're quite hard to interpret as real shapes. In most
  cases this doesn't matter, but there are use cases for using plain shapes rather than paths,
  to make things clearer to users.</p>

  <h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access/#Re-Using">Re-usable components"</a></h3>

  <p>the <code>use</code> element gives SVG something like what Web Components is still trying
  to bring to HTML a decade-odd later. The ability to take a well-known component, and re-use it
  with a bit of relevant styling or other tweaking in turn supports the Web as a medium for annotating
  objects identified by a URL (such as <code>defs</code>) to support accessibility.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/struct.html#DescriptionAndTitleElements">title and description</a></h3>

  <p>The way you can use these at appropriate levels of structure is a very nice thing.</p>

  <p>The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element maps to the accessible name, and the <code>&lt;desc&gt;</code> element maps to the accessible description in the accessibility API.</p>

  <p>We should mention the lang attribute for internationalisation/accessibility.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/struct.html#DOMInterfaces">DOM</a></h3>

  <p>Everything now uses the DOM, so it's helpful to have one.</p>

  <h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access/#Fonts">Fonts</a></h3>

  <p>Now enhanced to match the new technology, fonts are a much nicer thing to do than simply adding a lot of paths to convey some text.</p>

  <h2>New improvements</h2>

  <h3><a href="https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/interact.html#Focus">tabindex</a></h3>

  <p>Being able to build a keyboard navigation map around an SVG is a great thing. Element-wise navigation is a fallback strategy for users who don't have a choice, but it is unlikely to be a good one if the author has done a half-way reasonable job.</p>

  <p>Describe tabindex attribute, plus outcome of using -integer, 0, or +integer values.</p>

  <p>Should we mention other keyboard related things, like the <a href="https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/interact.html#focusable">focusable</a> attribute?</p>

  <h3><a href="https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/struct.html#WAIARIAAttributes">ARIA attributes</a></h3>

  <p>The ARIA role attribute (<a href="https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/struct.html#roleattribute">5.10.1</a>), based on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#role_definitions">ARIA roles definitions</a>. ARIA properties and states (<a href="https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/struct.html#ARIAStateandPropertyAttributes">5.10.2</a>), as defined in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#state_prop_def">ARIA states and properties</a>. Plus implicit ARIA semantics (<a href="https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/struct.html#implicit-aria-semantics">5.10.3</a>).</p>

  <p>For example, can use <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#img">role="img"</a> on the <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> element. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#presentation">role="presentation"</a> can also be used to remove child shape elements from the accessibility API. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-label">aria-label</a>and <a href=
  "http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-labelledby">aria-labelledby</a> attributes can be used to associate the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;desc&gt;</code> elements. The <a href="www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-label">aria-describedby</a> attribute can also be used, but has poor AT support in spite of reasonable  browser support.</p>

  <p>Info on <a href="http://blog.paciellogroup.com/2013/12/using-aria-enhance-svg-accessibility/">basic ARIA SVG support</a>, plus simple <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2805347/web/test-cases-svg-aria.html">SVG ARIA test cases</a>.</p>

  <h2>Just different</h2>

  <h3>onclick is accessible now</h3>

  <p>DOMActivate was dropped because it was unnecessary, and unhelpful. Lack of browser support and lack of author usage fed a vicious circle.</p>

  <p>But onclick can be triggered by almost any mode of interaction - which was what DOMActivate tried to enable. So we have the functionality, even if it has a name that seems limiting.</p>
